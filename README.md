# Two-factor-authentication-OTP-security-
OTP Generation and Verification using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
This repository contains a simple web application that demonstrates how to generate and verify One-Time Passwords (OTP) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. OTPs are commonly used for two-factor authentication and secure user verification processes.
This project provides a basic implementation of OTP generation and verification. The application allows users to generate a 6-digit OTP and then enter it for verification. The OTP is generated on the client-side using JavaScript, making it suitable for small-scale projects or educational purposes.
